  <h1>JAMIE'S PROJECTS</h1>
  <p>I am brand new at learning to write HTML, but I am very excited about the possibilities!
    Right now, I work at a fantastic eLearning company in the Professional Services group,
    but I also have a family (including three teenaged boys!) and a photography company with my husband.
    We enjoy the beautiful, sunny locations in Florida, but I really do miss my home state of Washington.

    <h3>What I really want to do, however, is rewrite our photography site.</h3>
      <p>Currently, we are using a very old template.
      It just doesn't look great, we don't have recent work featured, and the template is not only old-fashioned, but also limiting.
      You can see it for yourself at:
