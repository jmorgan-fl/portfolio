  <h1>Wecome to My Portfolio of Projects</h1>
  <section>
  <p>I am brand new at learning to write HTML, but I am very excited about the possibilities!
    Right now, I work at a fantastic eLearning company in the Professional Services group,
    but I also have a family (including three teenaged boys!) and a photography company with my husband.
    We enjoy the beautiful, sunny locations in Florida, but I really do miss my home state of Washington.
  </p>
  <br>

    <h2>So, just how new am I to writing HTML?</h2>
    <p>You will have to check out one or both of my first two project pages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First Code</li>
      <li>Random Panda Page</li>
    </ol>

      <nav>
        <a href=file:///C:/Users/jmorgan/Desktop/first-code/index.html>First Code</a>
      </nav>
        <img src="new.jpg" alt="Meme about being new.">
        <nav>
          <a href=file:///C:/Users/jmorgan/Desktop/semantic-elements/index.html>Random Panda Page</a>
        </nav>
        <img src="panda.jpg" alt="Abstract Panda image copyright by Megapixl.com.">

    <h3>What I really want to do, however, is rewrite our photography site.</h3>
      <p>Currently, we are using a very old template.
      It just doesn't look great, we don't have recent work featured, and the template is not only old-fashioned, but also limiting.
      You can see it for yourself at:
