          <p class="paragraph-class">I am brand new at learning to write HTML, but I am very excited about the possibilities!
          Right now, I work at a fantastic eLearning company in the Professional Services group,
          but I also have a family and enjoy photography as a side-business.</p>
          <p class="paragraph-class">We enjoy the beautiful, sunny locations in Florida, but I really do miss my home state of Washington.</p>
