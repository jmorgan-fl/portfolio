  <h1>JAMIE'S PROJECTS</h1>
  <p>I am brand new at learning to write HTML, but I am very excited about the possibilities!
    Right now, I work at a fantastic eLearning company in the Professional Services group,
    but I also have a family and enjoy photography as a side-business.
    We enjoy the beautiful, sunny locations in Florida, but I really do miss my home state of Washington.

    <div class="main-body-class">
        <p>You will have to check out one or both of my first two project pages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First Code: This is the very first page I ever coded. You can click on the link below labeled "First Code" to see it.
          </li>
          <li>Random Panda: This is the second page I did.  You can click on the link below labeled "Random Panda" to see it.
          </li>
          <li>Stephanie & Morgan - one of our absolute favorite weddings! So easy to photograph.
          </li>
          <li>Straz Center: One of my favorite places to shoot is onstage & backstage - without a production. Talk about drama!
          </li>
          <li>
          </li>Low Light & Interior: This is probably our second-most 'proof of experience' collection that we are asked for when a client is vetting us.
        </ol>

  <h2>The Photography Site:</h2>
      <p>It needs updating!  We are using a very, very old template.
      It just doesn't look great, we don't have recent work featured, and the template is not only old-fashioned, but also limiting.
      You can see it for yourself at:
